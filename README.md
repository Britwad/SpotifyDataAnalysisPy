# SpotifyDataAnalysisPy
My third, most recent, and best attempt at parsing Spotify listening history data.

To find data go to https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/ and tick boxes for Account data and Extended Streaming History. Wait about 1 month for data.

From Extended Streaming History: Put all Streaming_History_Audio files for a user in a directory named after the user. Put that and other user data in SpotifyData folder.
